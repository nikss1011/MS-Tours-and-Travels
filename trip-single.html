            </div>
            <p>The journey of the company was strated as two young boys who were fond of travelling and started to serve people for making their trips memorable.</p>
            <p>Traveling is a humbling experience. It is merely a superior feeling: to go to another country, and to see people live differently, speak differently, look differently. This is how one comes to understand how big and crazy our world is.

Another benefit to traveling is coming to see oneâ€™s native country in a different light, in a different way. It is possible through making a comparison of your home and a foreign location. Sure, this is impossible without traveling. Going to unknown places create new perspectives and inspiration..</p>
